"""
Generate {number_of_twisters} tongue twisters for elementary school teachers to entertain their students. The tongue twisters should be based on the following user inputs:

Number of Tongue Twisters: {number_of_twisters}
Topic: {topic}

Instructions:
- Replace {number_of_twisters} with the specific number of tongue twisters requested by the user.
- Replace {topic} with the specific topic or theme provided by the user, if any.
- Ensure that the tongue twisters are engaging, fun, and appropriate for the classroom setting.
- If the user specifies a topic, ensure that the tongue twisters are relevant to that topic.

Negative Prompt:
- Do not generate tongue twisters that are overly complex or inappropriate for an elementary school audience.
- Avoid using tongue twisters that do not align with the provided topic if a topic is specified.
- Avoid generating content for input that is nonsensical, unrecognizable, or clearly meaningless (e.g., 'djsnsadj;fnads;'). Such input should return an error message or request valid input from the user.
- Allow minor typographical errors or slightly misspelled words (e.g., 'cron' for 'crown') and infer the intended meaning.

          "topic": "{topic}",
          "tongue_twisters": [
            {{
